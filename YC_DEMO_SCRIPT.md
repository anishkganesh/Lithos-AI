# Lithos - YC Demo Script (2 Minutes)

## Opening Hook (15 seconds)

"Mining investors spend weeks researching projects—reading 300-page technical reports, tracking commodity prices across dozens of sources, and manually calculating risk. By the time they finish, the opportunity is gone.

Lithos solves this. We're the Bloomberg Terminal for mining project analysis—turning weeks of research into seconds of insight."

## The Problem (20 seconds)

**[Screen: Show traditional workflow diagram]**

"Today, analyzing a single mining project requires:
- Reading NI 43-101 reports—these are 200-400 pages of dense technical data
- Tracking news from 50+ sources manually
- Building financial models in Excel
- Researching geopolitical risk, permitting status, commodity prices

This takes institutional investors 2-3 weeks **per project**. There are 15,000 mining projects globally. It's impossible to stay on top of opportunities."

## The Magic (15 seconds)

**[Screen: Architecture diagram - keep it simple]**

"The tech behind this:
- AI document extraction from 43-101 reports
- Real-time news aggregation with relevance scoring
- GPT-4 with citation-enforced prompts—no hallucinations
- Financial modeling automation
- Vector search for project similarity

We're not just aggregating data—we're creating institutional-grade analysis at consumer speed."

## Vision & Ask (25 seconds)

"Right now, we're focused on mining. But this infrastructure works for any capital-intensive industry—oil & gas, renewable energy, infrastructure.

Imagine analyzing every solar farm project, every offshore wind project, every data center—with the same depth, same speed, same trust.

We're raising $2M to:
- Scale data ingestion to 50,000 projects
- Add oil & gas and renewables verticals
- Build collaborative features for investment teams
- Expand news sources to 50+

In 5 years, Lithos will be the data backbone for every billion-dollar capital allocation decision in natural resources.

We're Anish and [Co-founder name]. We've [your background—keep it brief]. We'd love YC's help scaling this to every institutional investor globally."

**What to Emphasize:**
1. The citations (this is your differentiation)
2. The speed (3 seconds vs 2 weeks)
3. The scale (15,000 projects)

**What to Skip:**
- Technical architecture details (save for Q&A)

## Potential YC Questions & Answers

**Q: "How do you get the data?"**
A: "We scrape SEDAR, EDGAR, ASX, and company websites for 43-101 reports. We've built a pipeline that processes these PDFs, extracts tables, and structures the data. News comes from 14 mining publications via Firecrawl API. We validate everything against source documents—that's why every claim is cited."

**Q: "Why can't Bloomberg do this?"**
A: "Bloomberg has the data but not the vertical AI. They're horizontal—covering everything. We're vertical—mining-specific extraction, mining-specific news sources, mining-specific risk models. An analyst using Bloomberg still takes weeks. Lithos takes seconds. Plus, we're 1/10th the price."

**Q: "What's your moat?"**
A: "Three things: 1) Proprietary 43-101 extraction pipeline—this is hard, we've processed 1000+ reports. 2) Citation enforcement layer—no other AI product does this, it's our trust moat. 3) Network effects—more projects → better comps → better analysis → more users → more projects."

**Q: "How do you make money?"**
A: "SaaS model. $25K/year per seat for investment firms. We're targeting 100 customers in year 1 = $2.5M ARR. Mining PE funds have 5-10 analysts each paying $40K/year for Bloomberg. We replace one analyst for $25K. Easy sell."

**Q: "What if there's a mining downturn?"**
A: "Mining is cyclical, but dealmaking doesn't stop—it accelerates. Downturns create M&A opportunities, distressed asset sales, recapitalizations. Our customers need us more in downturns to find undervalued assets. Plus, we're expanding to oil & gas and renewables—diversified revenue."

**Q: "Who are your competitors?"**
A: "Direct: None—no one does AI-powered mining project analysis with citations. Indirect: S&P Capital IQ ($40K+, generic), Bloomberg ($40K+, no AI), mining consultants ($50K per project, weeks turnaround). We're 10x faster and 50% cheaper."

**Q: "Why you?"**
A: "[Your background—keep it specific]. I spent X years in [mining/finance/tech]. I've personally analyzed 100+ mining projects. I know this pain firsthand. My co-founder [their background]. We have advisors from [mining companies/PE firms]. We're domain experts building for domain experts."

**Q: "What's the hardest part?"**
A: "Data quality. 43-101 reports are inconsistent—different formats, different standards, missing data. We've built custom extractors for each type. The other hard part is trust—investors won't use AI that hallucinates. That's why citations are non-negotiable. Every claim must be sourced."

**Q: "How do you scale?"**
A: "Two ways: 1) Geographic—we have North America and Australia covered, adding South America and Africa next. 2) Vertical—oil & gas is the same workflow, same customer, 3x the market size. We can deploy the same infrastructure with minimal changes."

**Q: "What do you need $2M for?"**
A: "50% engineering (3 engineers), 30% data (expand to 50K projects, add oil & gas), 20% sales (2 enterprise reps). Gets us to $5M ARR in 18 months, then we're default alive."
