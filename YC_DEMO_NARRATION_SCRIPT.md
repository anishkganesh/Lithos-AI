## DEMO SCRIPT WITH LIVE COMMENTARY

### [0:00-0:15] OPENING (15 seconds)
**[Show: Globe view with all projects]**

> "Alright, so this is Lithos. Think Bloomberg Terminal but for mining projects. What you're seeing right now is our globe with 15,000 critical minerals projects worldwide—gold, copper, lithium, nickel, rare earths—all in one place.
>
> Before Lithos, mining analysts would spend weeks researching a single project—manually reading through 500-page technical reports, pulling out reserve estimates, calculating NPV, tracking down news. It's brutal."

---

### [0:15-0:30] PROJECT SCREENER (15 seconds)
**[Click to Projects Table view]**

> "So here's our main table. These are real mining projects with live data. You can filter by commodity, country, stage, any metric you want.
>
> **[Apply filters: Commodity = Gold, Country = Canada]**
>
> Let's look at Canadian gold projects. See all these metrics—NPV, IRR, CAPEX, reserves, production rates—we extract all of this automatically from technical reports.
>
> **[Click on "Macassa Mine"]**
>
> Let me show you how."

### [0:30-1:20] MACASSA MINE + METRICS (50 seconds)
**[Show: Project detail panel opens on right side]**

> "Okay, so this is Macassa Mine, my privately uploaded project. You can see all the key info here—$4.7 billion NPV, 27% IRR, Ontario location, feasibility stage.
>
> **[Scroll down to show all the metrics]**
>
> Now here's where it gets interesting. All of these metrics—$4.7B NPV, 2.1 million ounces of gold reserves, $1.2B CAPEX, 27% IRR—we extracted these automatically from the project's NI 43-101 technical report.
>
> **[Pause on metrics]**
>
> For context, these technical reports are typically 400-500 pages long. Normally, an analyst would have to read the entire document cover to cover to find the reserve estimate buried on page 87, the CAPEX breakdown on page 143, the NPV assumptions on page 201. That takes 2 weeks per project.
>
> We built an extraction pipeline that pulls this from the actual documentation automatically. What would take an analyst 2 weeks, we did in seconds.
>
> **[Scroll to show additional data]**
>
> And it's not just the numbers. We're also pulling in recent news—permitting updates, production results, commodity prices—so you get the full picture of every project."

### [1:20-1:45] AI CHAT (25 seconds)
**[Open AI chat panel]**

> "Now the really cool part. I can just ask questions about this project.
>
> **[Type: 'What are the main risks for Macassa Mine?']**
> **[Hit send, show AI response]**
>
> Instant analysis across four risk dimensions—geography, legal, commodity, team. It's pulling from the technical report, recent news, and comparing it to similar projects in our database.
>
> **[Type: 'How does this compare to other gold mines in Ontario?']**
>
> And it can do instant comparisons. This would take an analyst days to research manually. We just did it in 5 seconds."

### [1:45-2:00] CLOSING (15 seconds)
**[Return to globe view]**

> "So that's Lithos. We've indexed 15,000 projects, automatically extracted data from thousands of technical reports, and built AI that can answer any question about them instantly.
>
> We built this in 8 weeks. We're raising $2M to expand into oil & gas, then every capital-intensive market. Mining is a $2 trillion industry where every decision is still made in Excel.
>
> Questions?"

## KEY MOMENTS TO EMPHASIZE DURING DEMO

1. **Automatic Extraction**: "We extracted all the key metrics automatically from 400-500 page technical reports"
2. **Speed**: "What would take an analyst 2 weeks reading these reports, we did in seconds"
3. **Scale**: "15,000 projects, all with extracted data from technical documentation"
4. **Data Source**: "We pull directly from the official NI 43-101 technical reports and regulatory filings"
5. **AI Intelligence**: Show instant risk analysis and comparisons

## BACKUP TALKING POINTS (IF TIME ALLOWS)

- **Data Sources**: "We're pulling from SEDAR, SEC EDGAR, ASX, LSE—all public regulatory filings"
- **Extraction Technology**: "LLM-powered extraction pipeline that reads technical reports like an analyst"
- **Update Frequency**: "New filings processed within 24 hours, news refreshes daily"
- **Accuracy**: "We validate extracted data against multiple sections of the technical reports"

## PRACTICE NOTES

1. **Slow down at 0:30-1:20**: This is your money shot—extracting data from 487-page reports
2. **Pause when you open the PDF**: Let them see it's a real, massive technical report
3. **Point back to the metrics**: "All of this came from that report. Automatically."
4. **Be conversational**: You're showing them something you built that you're proud of
5. **Pre-load Macassa Mine**: Don't wait for it to load during demo

---

## Q&A PREP (After Demo)

**Expected questions:**
1. "How accurate is the extraction?"
   - "We use GPT-4 with structured extraction prompts and validate across multiple report sections. For critical metrics like NPV and reserves, we cross-reference with company filings."

2. "How do you get the data?"
   - "We scrape public filings from regulatory bodies—SEDAR for Canada, SEC EDGAR for US, ASX for Australia. All public data, updated automatically."

3. "What's the business model?"
   - "SaaS. $500/user/month for analysts, enterprise plans starting at $50K/year for funds and mining companies."

4. "Who are your competitors?"
   - "S&P Capital IQ has the data but no extraction or AI. Analysts still read reports manually. We're the only ones automating the entire research workflow."

5. "What's your traction?"
   - "8 weeks in, 15,000 projects indexed, 5 design partners using it daily, 2 LOIs from mid-market funds. Early users tell us we're cutting research time from 2 weeks to 2 hours per project."

6. "Can this work for other industries?"
   - "Absolutely. Oil & gas next—same structure, SEC filings, reservoir reports. Then real estate, infrastructure. Any capital-intensive industry with standardized technical reports."

## FINAL REMINDER

**The ONE thing they must remember: "Lithos automatically extracts structured data from 500-page technical reports. What takes analysts weeks, we do in seconds."**

Make them see you open that 487-page PDF, then show how all the metrics were extracted automatically. That's your wow moment.
